This repository contains the code for my personal portfolio website, showcasing my skills and interests in mechanical engineering, photography, and coding. The website features a minimalist design with a smooth transition between an introductory section and the main content.

**Key Features:**
Multilingual Intro: The intro section displays "I am DiJay" in five different languages: Tamil, Hindi, Arabic, French, and English, with smooth fade-in and fade-out animations.
Smooth Transitions: After the intro section fades out, the main content section smoothly fades in, presenting my personal information and professional background.
Project Navigation: The site includes a projects section with interactive navigation buttons to cycle through various project descriptions.
Responsive Design: The layout is mobile-friendly and adjusts to different screen sizes for optimal viewing.
**Technologies Used:**
HTML5: Structure of the web pages
CSS3: Styling, animations, and transitions
JavaScript: Interactive elements, smooth transitions, and dynamic content loading
**Future Enhancements:**
Add more project details and portfolio sections
Include a contact form for visitors to get in touch
Improve accessibility features
